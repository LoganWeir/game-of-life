# The Game of Life

How complicated can I make this? I guess I'm finding out!

Run with `./game_of_life` (or call that file from where ever you want)

This will cd you into this directory, activate the venv (or create one if you don't have it), install the pip requirements, and run the file

The generated gif can be run in chrome after the program completes.

# To Do

- [ ] Allow for custom seed generation w/ tkinter
- [ ] Customize grid size and steps
- [ ] Show progress in tqdm
- [ ] 'Infinite' grid size (or wrap-around grid)
- [ ] Think of more silly things to add
